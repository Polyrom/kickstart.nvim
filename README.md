# Neovim config

I try to be as bare-bones here as possible, keeping only the functionality and UI I actually use.
I use it mostly for Python and Go development.

+ LSP
+ Fuzzy find
+ Debugger integration
+ Git integration
+ Tmux interoperability

_As always, the config is a work in progress_

### Forked from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
Enormous shoutout for providing a supersolid basis for the config, especially handling the tricky LSP + cmp integration.
